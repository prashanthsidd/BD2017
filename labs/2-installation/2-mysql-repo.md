I am working on ubuntu and I directly installed MySQL 5.5 through apt-get. Hence I don't have any mysql.list 
files under my apt directory.

Command used for installing MySQL 5.5:

    sudo apt-get install mysql-server-5.5

Command to configure MySQL server:

    sudo mysql_secure_installation
    
Command to install db:

    sudo mysql_install_db
